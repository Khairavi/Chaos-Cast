Introduction to Chaos Theory
Chaos theory is the study of complex, dynamic systems where small changes in initial conditions can result in vastly different outcomes. In weather forecasting, this sensitivity explains why predictions are often uncertain—tiny variations in temperature, pressure, or humidity can amplify over time, creating a "butterfly effect."

Project Overview
Our Chaos Weather Forecasting Project explores the unpredictable nature of weather using chaos theory. By examining how slight shifts in factors like temperature and pressure alter long-term predictions, this project aims to reveal the challenges and potential of forecasting. This tool provides insights into the sensitivity of weather systems, inviting users to explore how minor adjustments can create large-scale impacts.

Key Features
Real-time weather predictions and interactive simulations
Adjustable parameters like temperature, pressure, and humidity

2. Forecasting Model Explanation
Chaos Theory Basics
In chaotic systems like weather, tiny changes in initial conditions (like temperature or air pressure) lead to significant differences in outcomes. Known as the butterfly effect, this sensitivity means that even the most advanced weather models struggle with long-term accuracy.

Model Explanation
Our model relies on chaos theory to simulate weather changes based on small adjustments. Using data inputs for temperature, pressure, and humidity, the model generates forecasts that evolve dramatically based on minor changes. This project integrates algorithms that factor in non-linear dynamics, where each variable influences the next, amplifying unpredictability.

Sensitivity Concept
One core principle of chaos theory is sensitivity to initial conditions. This project showcases this concept through interactive sliders, where users adjust parameters to see how even a slight change can drastically alter the forecast. This is the reason why weather prediction, even with advanced technology, is often unreliable beyond a few days.

3. Real-Time Weather Predictions
Live Forecast
Here, users can view the current weather forecast generated by the model. This includes:

Temperature – Current temperature predictions based on real-time or simulated data
Pressure – Atmospheric pressure predictions impacting weather patterns
Humidity – Humidity levels affecting precipitation forecasts
Interactive Map
The forecast is displayed on an interactive map, allowing users to view changes for different regions. Hover over or click on any region to see detailed predictions and compare adjustments made with the sliders (below).

4. Data Visualization & Interactive Controls
Graphs and Charts
Graphs show current data on temperature, pressure, and humidity. Additionally, users can see line charts of predictions over time, showcasing how predictions shift based on changes in initial conditions.

User-Controlled Simulation

Adjustable Sliders: Users can change values for:
Temperature – Adjust in increments of 1 degree.
Pressure – Adjust by 10 hPa.
Humidity – Adjust in increments of 5%.
Simulation Effect:
As users move the sliders, the model recalculates the forecast. Results are displayed as dynamic shifts in temperature, precipitation, and wind on the map. An accompanying note describes the "butterfly effect" at work, showing how even a slight increase in temperature or a dip in pressure creates a ripple of changes, reinforcing the challenges of weather prediction.
